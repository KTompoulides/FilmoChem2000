# FilmoChem 2000

FilmoChem 2000 is an arduino powered "thermostat" for processing colour film at home. The arduino board is used to control a heating element as well as a circulation pump.
By using 3 temperature sensors we have a temperature readout not only for the water bath but also for 2 of our chemicals, the developer and the blix in the case of C-41 colour negative film.

## Parts Used

1) 1x Arduino uno
2) 1x Relay module board
3) 1x Adafruit SH110X compatible OLED display.
4) 3x DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensors.
5) 1x D-PAD board salvaged (from a broken phillips TV).
6) 1x 12V circulation pump.
7) 1x 220VAC submersible heating element (from an old washing machine).
